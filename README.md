* The pipeline includes transforming raw audio recordings of bird species into spectrograms and using that information to train the model.
* Spectrogram samples coupled with image processing techniques and Neural Networks are used to build a classification model.  
* This automated classification model can help ecologists discover and understand species behavior in biodiversity hotspots.
